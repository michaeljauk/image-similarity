# Image Similarity

## Implemented datasets

1. [Caltech 256 Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/caltech256) (`caltech_256`)
2. Totally Looks Like Dataset (`totally_looks_like`)

## Config

1. Make a copy of `default.config.py` and rename it to `config.py`
2. Change all the paths to the datasets in `config.py` accordingly

## ToDo
- Split up Cal256 to Train, Test, Validation
- Upload the split up Cal256 dataset somewhere
- OIDv4:
- - Test different configs
- - Make tool iterate through all classes (stored inside the csv file)
